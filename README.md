# Power-bi-Dashboard-Project
# Mathav Ecommerce  Sells Dashboard 
"The owner of a store wants to improve their business by creating a dashboard to track and understand online sales all over India. In my  project for Power BI, I'm working on adding features to help them get useful insights from their sales data. This project aims to make it easy for them to see and analyze how well they're selling online in different parts of India. We're working together to use the power of data to make smart decisions and make their business even more successful.


# My Role in this project:
        1) Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers
        2) Created connections, join new tables, calculations to manipulate data and enable user driven parameters for visualizations
        3) Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, 
           slicers, etc)
